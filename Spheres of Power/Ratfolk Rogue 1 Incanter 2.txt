Spell Points - 7 = (CHA) 5 + (Inc 2) 1 + (Drawback 1) 1
  DRAWBACK: Somatic Casting I

Spheres & Talents - 5 = 2 + (Inc 2) 3

  Sorcerer Bloodline: Naga
    - Invisibility: [Inc+STAT=7] rounds/day

  Telekinesis (Focus)
    (F) CaL bonus       - +1
    --- Telekinesis     - Lift object of size depending on CaL (@CaL 3, Tiny)
                          Changing direction is a move action
    --- Sustained force - 1 SP, simple commands, 1min/CaL (=3)
         ↳ I take for granted that if cast on self, you effectively gain the
           benefits of the Flight talent without taking that talent.
    --- Hostile lift    - Will save negates each round
    --- Bludgeon        - Attack with weapon or object.
                          Small objects deal 1d4; adjust die for size categoroy
    (F) TK Stability    - +2+[Lvl/5] bonus to Fly, Acrobatics, and CMD.
    (F) TK Impediment   - Immediate action, 3+[STAT]/day
                          Apply a penalty of -1-[Lvl/5] to anyone's attack roll
    (*) Finesse         - Telekinesis can perform fine manipulations,
                          make skill checks at -5 penalty
    (*) Flair           - May apply feats to bludgeon attacks
    (*) Greater Speed   - Speed is 35ft = 30+5*[CaL/2]
    (*) Powerful TKS    - Size increases by one category (Tiny -> Small)
    (*) Steal           - Use TKS on attended objects. Will saves. Steal or
                          Disarm combat maneuver at CMB = 4 = [CaL + STAT - 5]

============
Random notes


Telekinesis + Ratfolk + Powerful Telekinesis + Flight (maybe):
  Character can fly at level 3 at 20ft/round
  Greater Speed: from 20+5*[Lvl/5]ft to 30+5*[Lvl/2]ft
  Focus 
    @ Lvl 3: 40ft

Subtract flight, and you can at least lift yourself.
Changing direction is a move action though.

Divided mind + Finesse + Flair lets you be a ranged melee fighter,
but I'd rather rain down fireballs.

Flair to aply feats
Finesse + Flair for Disable Device
Finesse + Steal for Sleight of Hand
Flair + Steal to apply Improved Steal

Naga bloodline gives easy access to invisibility to ensure incognito entry and exit
Teleport from the Warp sphere should get past any locked windows and doors
Bag of holding and you have the best thief ever?

Hostile Lift should be able used to 


DRAWBACK for Telekinesis is nothing special -- it affects only one element type,
  a la Avatar:TLAB
The fact that you can do this on Concentration is pretty awesome; you get free,
unlimited flight.

FOCUS:
  Caster Level +1 with sphere
  Ongoing: Telekinetic Stability
    +2+[Lvl/5] bonus to Fly, Acrobatics, and CMD.
  Special ability: Telekinetic Impediment
    Immediate action, 3+[STAT]/day
    Apply a penalty of -1-[Lvl/5] to anyone's attack roll
  8th-level ability: Great Flight
    Flight speed of 50 for [Lvl] minutes per day
    Nonconsecutive, but spent in 1-min increments
